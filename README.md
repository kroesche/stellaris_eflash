eflash
======

This is the eflash utility, used for firmware update of Stellaris/Tiva
microcontrollers via ethernet.  This program runs on a host PC and
assumes the "boot_eth" app is running on the MCU and connected to
ethernet network.

This version is taken directly from StellarisWare for LM3S, rev 10636
and is unmodified.  This does not build on a Mac.
